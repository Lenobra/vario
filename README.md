# vario
STM32L476RG based vario for measuring vertical hight, speed with battery supply.  
By Leonard & Bastian
## Aspiration
This Repo is for a study projekt in Mikrocomputertechnik for the 3rd semester. That's why it's covering the main features of it but not the complete build of a selfmade variometer. It's open source and can be used for anyone else to support their idea.

# Documentation
RTM - oh wait, there is no documentation. That's right. It's for a school project and not required.  
Writing documentation for a hobby >> writing documentation not required for an school project.  
But in the sence of open source project we tried to make the concept and the features quickly and easily accessible. You can be sure that the features shown in the video work on an stm32 for detailed implementation look in the code. Properly only helpfull for ones which actually already work on a similar project.  
If you need more information read the bericht-abgabe.docx file. But I would recommend not to. It's in german btw.













































I use Arch btw.
