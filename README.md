# vario
STM32L476RG based vario for measuring vertical hight, speed with battery supply.  
By Leonard & Bastian
## Aspiration
This Repo is for a study projekt in Mikrocomputertechnik for the 3rd semester. That's why it's covering the main features of it but not the complete build of a selfmade variometer. It's open source and can be used for anyone else to support their idea.

# Wireing
